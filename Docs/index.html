      Extended Memory Semantics
    </h1>
    <p class="pmulti" >
      <span style="font-size: 1.1em; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">
	Extended Memory Semantics (EMS) complements serial programming
	models with 
	transactional and other fine-grained synchronization capabilities
	to support parallel programming.
      </span>
      <br><br>
      Much of the challenge in implementing distributed and parallel
      programs derives from finding, marshaling, and synchronizing
      data. Extended Memory Semantics (EMS) unifies these tasks into a
      single programming and execution model.  EMS implements a shared
      address space with a rich set of primitives for parallel access of data
      structures. It is not a source of parallelism itself, instead it
      complements other parallel programming models and integrates shared
      memory data access and synchronization.
      <br><br>
      EMS leverages existing tool chains instead of replacing them and is 
      compatible with legacy applications, libraries, frameworks,
      operating systems, and hardware. 
      Because EMS represents 
      memory and not processes, it may persist independently of any
      application, and it's state may be replicated, archived, or forked.
      Applications may attach and detach from the memory in much the
      same way applications use a shared database or filesystem.
    </p>

    <P>
      <h6>Synchronization As a Property of the Data, Not a Duty for Tasks
      </h6>

    <p class="pmulti">
      EMS internally stores tags that are used for synchronization of
      user data, allowing synchronization to happen independently of
      the number or kind of processes accessing the data.  The tags
      can be thought of as being in one of three states, <em>Empty,
      Full,</em> or <em>Read-Only</em>, and the EMS primitives enforce
      atomic access through automatic state transitions.
      <br>
      <img style="clear:both; height:200px;  margin-left: 30px;"
	   src="./fsmSimple.svg" type="image/svg+xml" />
      <span class="figcaption">
	<br><br> EMS Data Tag Transitions & Atomic operations:
	F=Full, E=Empty, X=Don't Care, RW=Readers-Writer lock (# of current readers)
	CAS=Compare-and-Swap, FAA=Fetch-and-Add
      </span>
      <br><br>
      The function name <code>readFE</code> means "Read when full and mark empty",
      <code>writeEF</code> means "Write when empty and mark full",
      <code>writeXF</code> means "Write unconditionally and mark
      full", etc.  In the most simple case, full-empty tags are used
      to block readers until memory is marked full by a writer thread
      that itself blocks until the memory is marked empty.  This is
      effectively a dataflow or producer-consumer execution model that
      may involve any number of producers and consumers.

      <span class="figcaption">
	<br><br>EMS memory is an array of JSON primitive values
	(Number, Boolean, String, or Undefined) accessed using atomic
	operators and/or transactional memory.  Safe parallel access
	is managed by passing through multiple gates: First mapping a
	key to an index, then accessing user data protected by EMS
	tags, and completing the whole operation atomically.
      </span>
      <br><br>
      The EMS array may be indexed directly using an integer, or using a key
      mapping of any primitive type.  When a map is used, the key and data
      itself are updated atomically.
      <br><br>
      The full-empty primitives are
      used construct other thread-safe data types such as 
      atomic read-modify-write operations and Transactional Memory (TM).
    </p>


    <h3>
      Principles of Operation
    </h3>

    <p class="pmulti" >
      When the <code>require('ems')(...)</code> statement is executed by a program,
      EMS first creates a shared memory region to rendezvous and
      communicate with other EMS threads, then,
      using the built-in
      <img src="./nodejs.svg" type="image/svg+xml" height="16px" style="vertical-align:text-top;" />
      fork primitives, 
      creates the additional threads executing 
      using one of two execution models: fork-join or Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP).
      BSP invokes the same script as the master thread (found in <code>process.argv[2]</code>),
      whereas fork-join execution invokes parallel region around a function.
      <br><br>
      Under BSP, all threads execute the entire program unless statements are explicitly skipped.
      Fork-join parallelism has a single entry point and executes sequentially
      until a parallel region is started with  <code>ems.parallel( func )</code>.
      <br>
      <img style="width:200px; margin-left: 80px;" src="./BSPvsForkJoin.svg" type="image/svg+xml"  />
      <span class="figcaption"><br>
	Fork-Join parallelism follows the traditional single-threaded execution
	model until a parallel region where threads are dynamically added to
	perform iterations of a loop.  Under BSP parallelism every thread
	enters the program at the main entry point.    
      </span>
      <BR><BR>
      Fork-join creates parallel regions
      much like OpenMP's <code>#pragma omp parallel</code> directive.
      Under BSP, all threads enter the main program and execute all
      statements, synchronizing at barriers.

      <BR><BR>
      In addition to ordinary sequential loops,
      within a parallel region <code>ems.parForEach( func )</code>
      loops distribute iterations among the threads
      using several load balancing scheduling options.
      <br><br>
      The master thread preserves all the characteristics and capabilities of
      an ordinary 
      <img src="./nodejs.svg" type="image/svg+xml" height="16px" style="vertical-align:text-top;"/>
      job, and all legacy applications, modules, packages, frameworks, and test apparatus
      will work normally.  Software that does not use EMS is not affected by it's presence.
      <br><br>
      Atomic operations like compare-and-swap (CAS) and fetch-and-add (FAA)
      that are typically non-blocking will block if the full/empty
      tag is set to empty.
      Stack/queue operators are deadlock free,
      blocking operations and should be thought of as thread-safe but not concurrent.
      EMS transactions are also deadlock free and support element-level locking
      for the highest possible currency.
      <br><br>
      Dataflow programs directly manipulating the full/empty tags
      may deadlock if a program attempts to re-acquire a lock
      already held, or acquire locks in a different order than other threads.
      <br><br>
      EMS programs may be run with any number of threads, including
      single threaded and over-subscribed.

    <h3>Built-In Composed Operations and Parallel Data Structures</h3>
    <p>
      High-level data abstractions can be constructed from the EMS primitives,
      and EMS itself 
      composes the primitives to implement transactional memory (TM), stacks, and queues.
      User defined composed operations can be added to EMS classes just as new methods
      are added to other JavaScript objects.
    </p>



    <h6>Transactional Memory</h6>
    <P>
      Transactional Memory (TM) provides atomic access to multiple shared objects
      in a manner similar to transactional databases.  EMS implements mutual exclusion
      on specific data elements using the Full/Empty tags,
      and shared read-only access with a multiple readers-single writer tag.

    </p>




    <h6>Stacks and Queues</h6>
    <P>
      Parallel-safe stacks and queues are built-in intrinsics based on Full/Empty tags.
      Stacks and queues are by definition serial data structures and do
      not support any concurrency.  Although highly efficient, a shared
      resource like these can become a hot-spot when dozens of threads compete
      for access.
    </p>

      Historical Precedents for Data-Centric Multithreading
    </h5>
    <p  class="pmulti">

      EMS builds on three experimental computer architectures from the
      1980's: the NYU Ultracomputer, the MIT J-Machine, and the Tera Multi-Threaded Architecture (MTA).

      Specifically, the Ultra introduced combining networks as a basic
      architectural feature,
      the J-Machine made moving a task to data as easy as moving data to the processor,
      and the MTA used massive multithreading to mask latency and
      had fine-grained synchronization associated with the data, not tasks.

    <h6>
      Languages and APIs
    </h6>
    <P>
      In addition to JavaScript, EMS can be added to other languages.  Languages that can share the EMS API:
      <br> - Python
      <br> - C/C++
      <br> - PHP
      <br> - Java
      <br> - Perl
      <br> - Your name here
    </P>


    <h6>
      Examples, Benchmarks, Tests
    </h6>
    <P>
      Other programs included with the distribution for demonstration, test, and benchmarking purposes.

      <br> - Matrix multiply
      <br> - Graph500
      <br> - Sobel Filter
      <br> - MongoDB Replica Server
    </P>


    <h6>
      RiverTrail Extensions
    </h6>
    <P>
      A few years ago a proposed set of language extensions called RiverTrail 
      was being supported by Intel and was implemented as a Firefox Plug-In.
      The hooks used by the extension are no longer supported in Firefox, and
      the future of RiverTrail is unclear.  To the extent possible, EMS should
      implement RiverTrail extensions.
